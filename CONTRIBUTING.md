# Contributing to AERIE

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AERIE.

AERIE is a governance-first AI execution architecture. Contributions are welcome, but **architectural integrity takes precedence over feature velocity**.

---

## Before You Contribute

Please read and understand the following documents first:

- DESIGN_PRIMITIVES.md
- ARCHITECTURE.md
- NON_GOALS.md

If a proposed change conflicts with any design primitive, the change will not be accepted.

---

## What We Accept

We welcome contributions that:

- Improve clarity, documentation, or examples
- Strengthen governance, auditability, or safety
- Implement functionality explicitly described in existing design documents
- Fix defects without altering architectural intent

---

## What We Do Not Accept

We do not accept contributions that:

- Introduce autonomous or self-directed agent behaviour
- Collapse cognition and execution responsibilities
- Rely on prompts or model behaviour for governance
- Bypass explicit intent, capability checks, or audit logging
- Add features that contradict NON_GOALS.md

---

## Design Changes

Architectural or design changes must:

- Clearly state which design primitive(s) they affect
- Justify the change explicitly
- Be discussed before implementation

Pull requests that introduce architectural drift will be closed.

## Code of Conduct

Be professional, respectful, and precise. This project values careful engineering over speed or hype.
